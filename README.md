# saptak
I made a client-based application. I found a client who needed an application for their upcoming business Saptak- A business offering lessons in Indian Classical Music. I made an app for my client wherein the teacher can offer lessons and join them, and the student can see and join offered lessons as per their skill level. I used Flutter and Dart to make an aesthetically appealing android/IOS app for my client using widgets. I used the Firebase Realtime Database, in order to send and retrieve data about students- skill level, name, age- and lessons- time, date, skill level.
